# Biscuit for Xresources

> This can be used in xterm and st, but to use it in st you'll need the [xresources](https://st.suckless.org/patches/xresources/) patch.

### Usage
Clone this repository, and inside the Xresources folder you should see both `.Xresources-light` and `.Xresources-dark` versions, make sure to copy the one you're going to use and rename it just to `.Xresources`.
